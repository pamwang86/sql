**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my workplace, i have access to the sales data and from there I will produce sales commission report. I make sure i will keep the data privacy and security measures intact, adhering to ethical standards. Transparency will be a key aspect of my approach, ensuring that stakeholders are informed about how their data is being used and protected.

To address equity components, I would take steps to ensure that the sales commission structure is fair and equitable for all employees. This might involve regularly reviewing the commission policies to identify and mitigate any potential biases or disparities. Additionally, I would advocate for transparency in the commission calculation process, ensuring that employees understand how their commissions are determined and have the opportunity to raise any concerns or questions.
